If there are lot of commits like 1001 to 1999 but only upto commit Id 1888 is stable and all the above commits are not required for release
Mening Head is pointing to 1999 and we have to move the Head to Stable version 1888
Then use git checkout Coomitid i.e git checkout 1888
Since we are unable remeber all these commit Id's we will use alias name unsin git tag aliasname commitid to be pointed
i.e git tag rele2 1888
